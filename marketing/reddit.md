**Title** `Petals App - New app to control weed use`
**Description** 
```
Hey guys!
In the last couple of months my partner and I developed an app to control if/how we consume cannabis.

It's Open Source and Free. The source code can be found [in github](https://github.com/LeoColman/Petals)

You can download it automatically in [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/br.com.colman.petals/) or download the APK 
directly from the [releases page](https://github.com/LeoColman/Petals/releases)

We've also made it available in the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=br.com.colman.petals), but it's a paid app there.
No difference otherwise.

We're looking to improve the app more as we continue to understand the big world that cannabis is.

**Main Features**

- Track how much you're consuming
- See the last time you've consumed and a counter on how long you've gone
- See research-based suggestions on damage reduction and understanding withdrawal
- Enjoy having your data anywhere you want exporting and importing simple CSV files

```
